Ozempic Project Machine Learning

Delving into the effects of Ozempic on obese and hypertensive patients aged 40-75. A key focus is on addressing endogeneity to estimate the treatment effect accurately. Through exploratory data analysis, data merging, and the application of
advanced statistical techniques, you will uncover causal relationships and provide insights into the dataset. 

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Conducted a thorough exploration of the datasets. This included understanding the structure, identifying missing values, and summarizing key statistics.
Generated visualizations to understand the distribution of important variables, relationships between different variables, and any other patterns or anomalies in the data such as peculiar patterns or outliers.

Data Preprocessing and Merging:

Prepared the datasets for analysis by handling missing data, encoding categorical variables, and any other necessary preprocessing steps.
Merged the Medical and Prescription datasets appropriately, ensuring a coherent structure for further analysis.

Causal Analysis Setup:

Discussed the potential endogeneity issues in estimating the treatment effect of Ozempic on the target population.
Outlined a strategy for addressing endogeneity, referencing the big-picture problem of causality and treatment effect estimation discussed in class.

Model Development: Double-Lasso / Treatment Effect Lasso:

Implemented the double-lasso technique to estimate the treatment effect of Ozempic, considering the endogeneity of treatment assignment.
Justified the inclusion of variables in the model, explaining the rationale behind each decision.

Model Evaluation and Interpretation:

Evaluated the performance of the model, discussing the implications of the findings.
Interpreted the estimated treatment effects, providing insights into the impact of Ozempic on the target patient population.

Additional Insights:

Utilized the census and additional Ozempic information to enrich the analysis. incorporated these additional insights into the EDA section.
